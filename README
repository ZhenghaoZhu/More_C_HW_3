HW3 README FILE

How to run program: 
1) Run the following command: "make tests" *Do this from the directory ~/hw3-zhenzhu
    1a) The aforementioned command will run test*.sh files in the tests directory.

All helper methods correspond to one or multiple commands such as cd, pwd, ls, sort, etc.
Some functions have very specific names for specific functions.

Folders:
include/ Contains the single .h file used for tish
src/ Contains the single .c file which is the implementation of tish
tests/ Contains the .sh files and .txt files to automate the process of testing the shell and its multiple commands.

Documentation Used:
    https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-data-types.html

Testing using Valgrind:
    To test in valgrind, you will have to run it normally like: valgrind ./tish and input commands manually, non-interactive gives a lot of issues with valgrind.

LOGIC OF THE PROGRAM
    - The logic of the jobs relies on a single linked list using the Glib library
    - The tish_*_cmd() functions are used to print out debug statements whenever the -d flag is passed.
    - The tish_update_times() function is used to get the starting and ending times of a command execution.
    - tish_fg and tish_kill are exclusively used for their respective commands to handle jobs.
    - tish_all_else is used for commands which don't have a specific function.
        - Commands with specific functions include cd, pwd.
