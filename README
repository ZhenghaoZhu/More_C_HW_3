HW3 README FILE

How to run program: 
1) Run the following command: "make tests" *Do this from the directory ~/hw3-zhenzhu
    1a) The aforementioned command will run test*.sh files in the tests directory.

All helper methods correspond to one or multiple commands such as cd, pwd, ls, sort, etc.
Some functions have very specific names for specific functions.

Folders:
include/ Contains the single .h file used for tish
src/ Contains the single .c file which is the implementation of tish
tests/ Contains the .sh files and .txt files to automate the process of testing the shell and its multiple commands.

Documentation Used:
    https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-data-types.html

Testing using Valgrind:
    To test in valgrind, you will have to run it normally like: valgrind ./tish and input commands manually, non-interactive gives a lot of issues with valgrind.

LOGIC OF THE PROGRAM
    The logic relies 2 hash tables and 3 linked lists, all of them are provided by glib.

    mem_node_table - This hash table stores all currently alloced pointers. This is used to check if the pointer passed was already alloced in lkfree
    and lk_malloc. The logic of double pointers and orphan frees solely relies on this data structure.

    all_free - This hash table stores all the times lkfree was called, either sucessfully or unsuccessfully.

    memleak_ll - This linked list specifically stores frees or allocs that produce memory leaks

    bad_free_ll - This stores all other frees which are not appriate such as double frees and approximate frees.

    good_free_ll - This stores all the good frees that didnt have any problems.
